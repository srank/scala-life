Things to do:

* Various code smells (see FIXMEs) in Generation
* UI:
 ** show a generation
 ** allow back-and-forth between generations (ie, replay history)
 ** use actors to generate future generations ahead of the UI
* Abstract the rules out of Generation (allow for different rules)
* Could Coordinate be a parameterised class, to allow for more sophisticated automata?
* Load and save (may be an opportunity to use a parser on savefiles)
